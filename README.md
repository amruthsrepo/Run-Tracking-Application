# Run tracking android application

You can use this application to **track, store and access** your running sessions. It uses **firebase authentication** to store and retrieve user data. **Google maps API** is integrated to display the route in real time.


# Functionalities

This app, although simple, provides all the basic requirements for tracking runs. This is achieved through having multiple activities in the android app.

## Login and Registration

New users can register and the existing ones can login. The forms have complete error handling logic that is needed. Following are some screens that are used to achieve this-

## Runs history

A screen is built to display the previous runs and whenever a user clicks on one, the app will preview the route on the map-
